Astropy Feedback (and getting help)
===================================

Astropy is a package for the community, and the developers depend on the
feedback from users to understand how we can improve Astropy. 

There are several ways in which you can give us feedback:

* If you would like to give us feedback and participate in discussions, we
  encourage you to join the astropy_ mailing list and post
  there. This should be the preferred way if you are interested in having a
  discussion with the developers and other users.

* If you have feedback you would prefer to keep private,  you can e-mail
  `astropy-feedback@googlegroups.com`_.  This address points to a private mailing list that
  includes the astropy core developers.  If you would like a reply (e.g., an
  acknowledgement of your comment), please request it.

* For the extremely impatient, astropy developers often hang out in the
  #astropy freenode.net IRC_ channel, which can be accessed for free without
  registration from any IRC client (e.g., http://webchat.freenode.net/).

* We also welcome code posts as `issues`_ (or `pull requests`_) on github and
  as posts to the `astropy-dev`_ google group.
