What is Astropy?
----------------

The Astropy project is a common effort to develop a single core package for
Astronomy that brings together almost 100 developers from around the world.

Development is actively ongoing, with major packages such as `PyFITS`_,
`PyWCS`_, `vo`_, and `asciitable`_ already merged in, and many more components
being worked on. In particular, we are developing imaging, photometric, and
spectroscopic functionality, as well as frameworks for cosmology, unit
handling, and coordinate transformations. A first stable release is
tentatively scheduled for early May.

Stay updated by following `@astropy <http://twitter.com/#!/astropy>`_ on Twitter, or sign up to the `astropy@scipy.org`_ mailing list!

If you are interested in finding out more about the Astropy project, you can read the :doc:`original vision <vision>` for the package.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the latest development version of Astropy can be found
at `http://astropy.readthedocs.org <http://astropy.readthedocs.org>`_. This
documentation is automatically updated any time a commit is made to the
Astropy repository. Once a stable version of Astropy is released, we will
provide links to the documentation for that version.

Installing
----------

Detailed installation instructions are provided in the `documentation`_, but
we have included a simplified version here.

Astropy requires `Python`_ 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, or 3.2, and `Numpy`_ 1.4.0 or later.
You can install the latest developer version of Astropy using::

    git clone http://github.com/astropy/astropy.git
    cd astropy
    python setup.py install

Once a stable version of Astropy is released, we will provide links to the tar file, and updated installation instructions!

You can check that astropy is correctly installed by starting up ``python`` or ``ipython``, and importing ``astropy``::

    >>> import astropy

If you do not get any errors, the installation was successful!

Getting help
------------

If you want to discuss issues with other Astropy users and with the
developers, you can sign up to the `astropy <astropy@scipy.org>`_ mailing list!

Reporting issues
----------------

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker`_, and we will look into it promptly!
