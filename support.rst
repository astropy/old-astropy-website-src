Where to get help
-----------------

If you want to discuss issues with other Astropy users and with the
developers, you can sign up to the `astropy-users`_ mailing list. Note that
this is different from the `astropy`_ mailing list, which is intended for any
discussion regarding Python and Astronomy.

How to report issues
--------------------

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker`_, and we will look into it promptly!
