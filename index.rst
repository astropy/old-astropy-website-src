The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for 
Astronomy in `Python`_ and foster interoperability between `Python`_ astronomy packages.
Development is actively ongoing, with major packages such as `PyFITS`_,
`PyWCS`_, `vo`_, and `asciitable`_ already merged in, and many other components
are under development. For more details, on the plan for the Astropy
project, you can read the :doc:`original vision <vision>`, or the 
`documentation overview <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/overview.html>`_.

The current stable version is |currentstable|_.

Stay updated by following `@astropy <http://twitter.com/#!/astropy>`_ on Twitter, and sign up for the `astropy`_ mailing list, where you can ask python astronomy
questions of all sorts!  If you want to get involved in Astropy development
efforts, or other  more technical discussions of Astropy, join the 
`astropy-dev`_ list.

**Google Summer of Code 2013**: Astropy is officially a project for the Google
Summer of Code 2013, as part of the `Python organization
<http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013>`_ - if you are interested in
finding out more, or applying to work on Astropy, see our `Project ideas
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2013---Project-Ideas>`_
page for more details!


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the `astropy` core package is available at the
websites listed below. The first is for the most recent released
version.  The second is for a version of the documentation that is 
automatically updated any time a change is made to the 
`astropy source code repository <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

* `Stable version (docs.astropy.org) <http://docs.astropy.org>`_
* `Latest developer version (devdocs.astropy.org) <http://devdocs.astropy.org>`_
* :doc:`All versions <docs>`
    


Installing
----------

Detailed installation instructions are provided in the `documentation`_, but
we have included a simplified version here.

Astropy requires `Python`_ 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3, and `Numpy`_ 1.4 or later. The 
best way to install astropy is to use `pip`_::

    pip install astropy
    
Or alternatively, you can download the source from the current version (|currentstable|_),
and install the source code in that archive using::

    python setup.py install

You can check that astropy is correctly installed by starting up ``python`` or ``ipython``, and importing ``astropy``::

    >>> import astropy

If you do not get any errors, the installation was successful!

.. note::

    If you want to install the latest *developer* version of Astropy, use::

        git clone https://github.com/astropy/astropy.git
        cd astropy
        python setup.py install

    Be aware that the developer build requires `Cython`_ (in addition to `Numpy`_).

Getting help
------------

If you want to discuss issues with other Astropy users, you can sign up
to the `astropy`_ mailing list.  Alternatively, the `astropy-dev`_ list
is where you should go to discuss more technical aspects of Astropy.

Reporting issues
----------------

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker`_, and we will look into it promptly!

Acknowledging the use of Astropy
--------------------------------

If you use Astropy for a publication, please consider adding the following
acknowledgment:

*This research made use of Astropy (http://www.astropy.org), a
community-developed core Python package for Astronomy.*

In the near future, we will publish a refereed paper describing Astropy, so
the above acknowledgment will be updated to reflect this.
