The Astropy project is a common effort to develop a single core package for
Astronomy that brings together almost 100 developers from around the world.

Development is actively ongoing, with major packages such as `PyFITS`_,
`PyWCS`_, `vo`_, and `asciitable`_ already merged in, and many more components
being worked on. In particular, we are developing imaging, photometric, and
spectroscopic functionality, as well as frameworks for cosmology, unit
handling, and coordinate transformations. A first stable release is
tentatively scheduled for early May.

Below, and in the menubar at the top of the page, you will find links to pages

If you are interested in finding out more about the Astropy project, you can read the :doc:`original vision <vision>` for the package.

We are always looking for more people to help develop various components of
Astropy. If you are interested in contributing, head over to the
:doc:`contributing` page which has all the information you need to get
started!
